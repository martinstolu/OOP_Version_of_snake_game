# 🐍 Snake Game (Turtle Graphics)

This is a classic Snake game built using Python's `turtle` module. 
It features a modular structure with clearly separated classes for the snake, food, and scoreboard. 
The snake grows with each food it consumes, and the speed of the game increases as the snake gets longer.

## 📦 Project Structure
- `main.py` – Runs the game loop and handles interactions.
- `snake.py` – Contains the logic for creating and moving the snake.
- `food.py` – Handles food generation and repositioning.
- `score_board.py` – Manages the scoring system and game over display.

## 🎮 How to Play
- Arrow keys control the direction of the snake.
- Eat food to grow the snake and increase your score.
- Avoid hitting the walls or your own tail to keep playing.

## 🛠 Features
- Dynamic speed increase as the snake grows
- Real-time score tracking
- Modular and readable object-oriented codebase

## 🚀 Getting Started
To run the game, make sure you have Python installed, then run:
```bash
python main.py
